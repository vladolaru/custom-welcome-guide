== Frequently Asked Questions ==

== How to create a guide?
From your WordPress admin dashboard, navigate to Guides tab and add a new Guide. To add screens (steps) to the guide, create a new guide and link it to the parent guide via the ```Page Attributes``` tab from the right sidebar.

= Can I create more than one guide? =
Absolutely! You can create as many guides as you want and link as many screens to them as you wish. A list with all the guides will be visible in the ```Welcome Guide``` tab from the block editor's sidebar.

= How to run the guides? =
When you are creating or editing a post, a "Welcome Guide" tab will be visible in the block editor's sidebar. Expand the tab and you will see a list with all the guides.

= Can I run the guides from the frontend? =
No, the scope of the plugin is to help your admin users or editors with the cms options and runs only from the WordPress block editor's screen.

= Can I run the guides from the Classic Editor? =
No, the plugin takes advantage of the pre-built Gutenberg components from the WordPress core and can only work with the new WordPress Block editor.
